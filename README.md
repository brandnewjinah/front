## üßê &nbsp; Challenges

#### Predicting Favorite Genres

- All genres are collected from liked movies. Then the favorite genres are predicted by counting the number of repeats of each genre.
- From the TMDB movie details API, genres for each movies are in an array. Some movies have an array with just genre ids and some with an array of objects with id and name.
- It was a challenge to analyze the format and conditionally apply slightly different functions to count the repeats.

#### Movie Recommendations

- To populate movie recommendations, I used TMDB's discover API extensively.
- Each time you land on the recommendations page, a random genre/keyword/movie is selected from your favorite movies. Then recommended movies based on the selection are populated on the page.
- This page seems to perform slightly differently across browsers. I would like to dive deeper to solve performance issues.
